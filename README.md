# ðŸŽ® WobblyWordle

## 1. Project Overview

**WobblyWordle** is a complete, desktop-based Word Guess Game application developed using **JavaFX**.
It follows a multi-tier architecture, separating the **database**, **business logic**, and **user interface**.

The application features two distinct user roles:

* **Player** â†’ for gameplay
* **Admin** â†’ for reporting and statistics

The core game challenges players to guess a randomly selected five-letter word in **five attempts**, providing **color-coded feedback** after each guess: ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ§ â¬œ
